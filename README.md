# Amath482_ComputationalMethodsForDataAnalysis
This repository comprises of projects done for the course Amath 482: Computational Methods For Data Analysis. 
Five projects are included; each folder contains MATLAB or Python code, data, and a report detailing the methods used and results obtained in the project.
The first project was about an ultrasound problem.The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm and the Gaussian Filter were implemented by using MATLAB software. 
The second project explored the characteristics and application of the Gabor Transform. Different types of wavelets were implemented by using MATLAB software. 
The third project applied the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to extract the position information of the oscillating mass and remove redundant information from videos by using MATLAB software. 
The fourth project was about music classification. The Singular Value Decompostion (SVD) was applied, and I developed my own Linear Discrimination Amalysis (LDA) algorithm to do machine learning by using MATLAB software. 
The fifth project was about the neural networks for classifying fashion MNIST. Two types of neural network were implemented, the fully-connected neural network and the convolutional neural network by using Python software.
